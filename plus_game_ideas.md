Enemy with spotlight looking for you. Level is darker, close pillars. When light sweeps over the enemy freaks out and starts shooting wildly.

Attract mode showing enemy types.

Enemy codenames: wall-e, bomb-r, form-l, snip-r, foun-t, bria-n, spot-r, hose-r

Enemies enter with distinct sound, or no sound for some.

Prompts: Get to the portal!

How do shots fizzle out?

Multiple suns, multiple shadows

Low sun, sunset world

Skyboxes with suns

# Effects

- Things that wobble and shake feel organic and/or scary
- Particles like: smoke. Fireflies. Wind in a direction. Snow. Rain. Or one general effect for depth and texture. SPARKS.js
- Ease down the clock multiplier for a very cool slow-mo effect. This will break clock-elapsed timers.
- Camera move: use ease in/out for move/rotate cinematic sweeps - tween js does this.
- Very slow rotate/pan is cool for a 'static' but live menu screen
